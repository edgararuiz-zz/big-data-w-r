Big Data with R 
---------------

### Presentation at the **Symposium on Data Science and Statistics** (SDSS) 2018 


*Abstract:* A review of techniques and R packages to aid in the success of Big Data analysis using R. The central idea is to use R to interface with the computation power of Spark, Hadoop, and/or databases remotely, as opposed to importing and analyzing in memory inside R. We will cover techniques for visualizing, modeling, scoring, dashboarding, and production pipelines.
